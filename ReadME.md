The New York City bus system serves over a million riders per day. Despite this, the system is plagued with delays and crawling speeds, partially due to illegally parked vehicles obstructing the busesâ€™ path. 

One of the methods employed by the MTA to combat this is Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE). Beginning with ABLE and expanding into ACE, MTA buses are able to ticket vehicles. 

This sparked three questions we hope to address: 
1. What is the recidivism rate and distribution of all ticketed vehicles?
2. How has the average mph on ACE routes changed compared to non-ACE routes, and how does Congestion Pricing factor into this?
3. Has ACE reduced accidents?


Check out our interactive map to see the analysis we did to answer these questions.
